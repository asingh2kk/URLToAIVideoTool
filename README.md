# URL to AI Video Tool

This full-stack web application is designed to analyze and process URLs, using AI models like GPT to generate summaries for blogs/articles. The project consists of a frontend built with Vite and Tailwind CSS for a responsive user interface, and a Node.js backend that handles API requests and integrates AI-powered functionality.

## Features
- **AI-Powered URL Analysis**: Leverages advanced language models such as GPT for generating intelligent responses and summaries based on the provided URLs.
- **Modern Frontend**: Built using **Vite** for fast development and **Tailwind CSS** for a highly customizable and responsive user interface.
- **Backend with Node.js**: Handles the core logic and API integration for AI model interaction.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Separates frontend and backend for easy development and deployment.
